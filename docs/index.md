## This page needs some maintenance

AT some point, I will need to remove the default text and place something meaningful about why do I do this project...

Meantime, below and the original text and hyperlinks:

-----------------------

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/omendezmorales/hello_rust/edit/master/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


For more details, see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/omendezmorales/hello_rust/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

*eager to see how I learn to edit gh pages*
I will consult this [source](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site) whenever I need to know something more about gh pages.
